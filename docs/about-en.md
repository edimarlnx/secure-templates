## Secure Templates: A Detailed Overview

**What is Secure Templates?**
Secure Templates is a powerful tool for securely rendering Go templates, using a secret manager to store confidential
data. It allows you to use Vault, a popular secret manager, to store access keys and tokens, and render their values
directly in template files.
**Benefits of Secure Templates:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Protects your confidential data against unauthorized access, storing it in a secure and
  encrypted location.
* **Simplified Secret Management:** Centralizes the management of access keys and tokens, making it easier for control
  and auditing.
* **Greater Flexibility:** Allows the rendering of dynamic values in Go templates, increasing the flexibility and
  customization of your applications.
* **Integration with Vault:** Supports native integration with Vault, facilitating the use of advanced secret management
  features.
  **How Does Secure Templates Work?**
  Secure Templates works in conjunction with Vault to securely render Go templates. The process works as follows:

1. **Template Definition:** You define your Go templates with special variables that represent the confidential values
   that will be stored in Vault.
2. **Secrets Storage:** You store your confidential data, such as access keys and tokens, in Vault in a secure and
   encrypted manner.
3. **Templates Rendering:** When rendering the template, Secure Templates queries Vault for the values of the special
   variables and inserts them into the template.
4. **Final Output:** The end result is a completely rendered Go template, with the confidential values replaced by their
   actual values.
   **Use Cases of Secure Templates:**
   Secure Templates can be used in several use cases, such as:

* **Application Configuration:** Rendering application settings, such as API URLs and access keys, securely and
  centrally.
* **Credentials Management:** Storing and managing database credentials, APIs, and other services securely.
* **Implementation of Authentication and Authorization:** Rendering access tokens and other authentication data in
  templates to control access to resources.
* **Configuration File Generation:** Creating dynamic configuration files based on values stored in Vault.
  **Additional Features of Secure Templates:**
* **Support for Various Template Formats:** Supports standard Go templates, as well as other formats like HTML and JSON.
* **Encryption of Values:** Encrypts confidential values before storing them in Vault, ensuring an additional level of
  security.
* **Granular Access Control:** Allows defining detailed access permissions to control who can view and modify
  confidential values.
  **Conclusion:**
  Secure Templates is a powerful and versatile tool for securely rendering Go templates, using Vault as a secret
  manager. It offers several benefits, such as enhanced security, simplified secret management, and greater flexibility.
